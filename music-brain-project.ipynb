    "### The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "36 Patients went into a MRI and listened to 5 minute long instrumental songs that were either meant to be uplifting or sad. The MRI recorded their brain activations and the patients used a sliding scale to represent how they felt while listening to the music.\n",

    "### Our Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a recurrent nueral network to predict how a patient felt at a moment in time, based off the MRI data from that moment. \n"

    "**DATA TYPES**\n",
    "The MRI data was actually a fMRI, so it was a series of MRI data, which itself was a 3D volumetric matrix of brain activations.\n",
    "The slider data was a text file with timestamps and activations, on a scale of 0 to 127, with 127 being very happy and 0 being very sad.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing the Slider Data\n",
    "The fMRI data was at 1 Hz but the slider data was at 30 Hz, so we had to down-sample the data.\n",
    "We used the average of the 30 measurements taken as the measurement for the one second.\n",
    "We also scaled the slider data to be on a scale of 0,1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bucketing the Data & Switching to Classification**\n",
    "We were having issues with regressing the data (see our conculsions section for more info) so we decided to switch to a classsification problem, transforming our slider data from a scalar to a class, either Happy or Sad.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing the MRI Data\n",
    "We used the niLearn package to transform our 4D fMRI (time steps, 3 spatial dimensions) to a 2D time series (time steps,\n",
    "features). The initial shape of the input tensor was (495,100,90,100) and we wanted it to be (495,#Features) so it could be fed into our Tensorflow LSTM.\n",
    "NiLearn has a class called NiftiMasker that does exactly that, transforming our data into an (495,250000) shaped time series. (This number of features is incedibly high we know, see our conclusions for more).\n"
